    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        candidate = nums[0]
        count = 1

        for i in nums:
            if i == candidate:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
            if count == 0:
                candidate = i
                count = 1
        return candidate
